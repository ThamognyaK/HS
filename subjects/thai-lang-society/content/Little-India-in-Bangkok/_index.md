### General

There are several places but the one placce a lot of indians go to would be the Little India in Bangkok where there are where you an find authentic indian food clothes and other necesities. This place is close Yaowarat which is busy and hene this also makes this place very busy and dynamic (but that does not take the beauty away from this place).If you are dont know what to do you can always book a tourist guide but I highly do not reccomend it as the gems can only be found after adventures. Additionally in the same region there is also the famous sikh temple near the street which also makes the street more popular.

### History

Formed during the Ayutthaya Era and is very old formed with the relationship that started Little India is the relationship betwen sikhs and the thais. It started as an communinty between skihs wherein sikh immigrants immigrated. This is why there ar several sikh temples near by and that is why the food and culture is heavily influcenced by sikhs. This along with the relationship between sikh immigrants and thailand at that time allowed for the sikhs to basically take a landd and make it an small ccountry with different tradditons.

There was a lot of trading between the ddifferent cultures and thus allowed for change of cultures and additionally quick economical growth in th grand-scale of things and thus allows for sikhs to grow quickly and also allow for the littl india to beome a big economical tourist giant in terms of economy (as it is one of the largest socio-econiomical and ethiniciticcal area).

### Trading and Items

There are several items always avaiable in the little india. Altough there is no trading, there are several items which are traditional and for sale and these items have some sort of connectiont to the indian subcontinent. They maybe religious, or etc. but they usually have some sort of connection to India.

### Shopping Malls

There are not a lot of Shopping malls but rather, small center shops where people sell indiviual items. This is better in my opinon as there are no large corporations and you are getting homemade-level of food, without the hassle. Additionally ther are other stalls that are not food, that can give an authentic feel when compared to buying it from a mega corporation mall.

### Food

This place in thailand contains a lot of aspects of indian culture the first and most obvious one being indian food that most indians are used to, considering the fact that most of the people who create / cook the food are inidans the food here is as authentic as it gets in thaialnd. This little indian street contains a lot of food with many stalls ([examples of stalls](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g293916-zfn15620382-Bangkok.html)) that contain food from vegetarien to halal to non-vegetarien and much more. Additionally one of the most popular dishes available is the "Samosa" an dish that is defried with an fillinng that everyone seems to love.

Futher more this place additionally contains much more aspects of india-thai culture mixed foods due to the foods not completely being native indian but an mix between thai and indian food which gives it this unqique tate and feeling that you can not find anywhere. But not to worry the food is predominately indian tasting and the thai bits are from the unique spices and from a spin on the original recipe which additonally in my opinons makes the food look better. Foods like that include meat also utilize different technqius than that is usedd in india for example.

### Religious Places

There are seveal religious places near Little India (phauarat), but none that i know that are inside of the region. These religous places are mostly bhuddist temples and are not related to india in any sort of way. That being said there are a lot of relgious items and placces inside of Little India which are all dominated by Indian charecteristics. There are also a lot of sikh temples inside of little india. These have a bit of different belives compared to indian temples but still have much more indian beliefs infused. This gives this place an authentic sort of feeling.

### Reflection

As a summary, in Little India provides an beautiful place, a second country like in thailand, that allows us to travel to India without having to travle to india itself. It shows us the beauty of the other cultures, without us having to go there, now I am not saying not visit other countries, but if you cannot places like Little India and China provide a similar experience with less hassles. Additionally most people there also experiment with a fusion / combination of 2 cultures, the one that they are in and the one that they represent whicch also gives unique experiences that cannot be found in either of those 2 cultures. Additionally if you are so inclined to then you can also learn new traditions and languages while you are here.
