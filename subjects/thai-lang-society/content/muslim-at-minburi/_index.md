The current Darul Abidin Mosque was constructed in 1933, this resembles the style of King Rama V to VI. Malay culture spread and combined with main Muslim culture in the area and spread via multiple modes. Additionally this also changed the architecture style, but never completely changed the way of living.

Additionally the malay language's accent also changed. Lastly there are multiple festivals and fairs happening all around focusing on the Muslim's way of living.

Additionally there are several organizations caterted towards muslims and muslim-based news. These allow for people within the same religion and group to feel like one and also increase the bond / connection between muslim people.

### Multiculturalism in the Heart of Bangkok

This video shwos mulitple evidences of muslim people allowing for other cultures and backgrounds to support each other of those who have the same religion. They have stated on multiple occasions that everything there is offerred in two languages (english and thai) which allows all muslim people regardless of where they are form to enjoy the prayers.

Additonally the meals provided are very similar to the ones they started with i.e biryani which is from India and Pakistan and the food ofered there is very similar to allow for more people to enjoy the delicacies.

Futher more everyone there were respectful to one another regardless of culture, and countries they are from but rather united by a singular faith in Muslim

### Personal Response

As a personal take on this, I had not known I was living in an muslim-area. I live in perfect place and altough I have heard the mosque's bell I had not known that minburi was an muslim covered area. Now after researching about everything and learning about the existance of this community I would to try out the biryani they offer and compare it with the ones that I have eaten.

Additionally I would also like to one day visit the more muslim-area in Minburi and break is comming up so that might be a good use of my time. I especially want to learn more about this not from an news source or etc. but rather directly from an Muslim person to gain a more first-person view of this topic. This will also increase my open-mindedness and cultural connections to other relgiions and learn about the perspectives that they have.

Finally I would also want to learn the architectural skills / types of architecture as I am very interested in their unique architecture and would like to utilize it my computer-model building and desigin classess. This new architecture would open a door of new wooden-type works and this might also create a new hobby for me.
